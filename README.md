# Daily dose of xkcd

Sends you a mail with a random comic from https://xkcd.com. 

Made to be run daily from a server. Personally I use it with a cronjob on my Raspberry Pi to send me a comic every morning at 9 AM. 

e.g. ```0 9 * * *``` https://crontab.guru/

Add you mail creditentials in the ```config.py```.
